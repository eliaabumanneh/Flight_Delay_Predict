# Flight Delay Predict

#### Data Science Bootcamp Capstone Project

# TLDR;

User inputs their origin airport, destination and airline. The tool predicts the expected flight delay and likelihood of cancellation.


#### Project Description: 
A tool that allows users to get a prediction on the likelihood of their flight being delay or cancelled using historical data and forecasted data. 

#### Project Limitations:
* Data Limitation: The data used in this tool is limited to the contingous United States and limited to the airport data provided by the Buereau of Transportation Statistics. 

* Modelling Limitation: Due to the large size of the data, the models have been subdivided by originairport to reduces modelling complexity by 2 orders of Magnitude.
